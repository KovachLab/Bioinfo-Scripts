            ii.) fastqcTrimmedData directory (In the FastQCReports directory) - fastQC reports generated from the trimmed sequencing reads (default .html & .zip output), as well as the reports compiled all into a .pdf.
            iii.) MultiQCReports directory - an .html file (and associated data) generated by multiqc which allows you to easily view qc reports across samples in one chart or table to readily identify any outliers or samples with weird behavior relative to the others. The resulting files should contain summaries for the bcl2fastq data (if available), the raw read fastqc files, the adapter removal settings files, and the quality trimmed fastqc files.
        C.) 20200728_INVS-SP_LFe_SparrowWholeGenomeShotgun_ELNLaTeXCode - Directory containing the following:
            i.) Code generated automatically as part of my data preprocessing script for inserting the FastQC pdf reports of the raw reads into my ELN

        E.) DataPreProcessing-20200728_INVS-SP_LFe_SparrowWholeGenomeShotgun-slurmOutput-2021.01.30-22.24.pdf - A copy of the file containing all of the slurm output and analysis metadata from the DataPreProcessingV1.3.1.sh analysis which performed all of the data preprocessing to transform the active files in this directory from the raw reads to the mapping-ready reads, i.e., it ran fastQC on the raw reads, performed adapter & quality trimming with adapter removal2, and reran fastQC on the quality trimmed reads. The file was generated and analysis job was submitted using LEF-DataPreProcessing.sh, which ran program DataPreProcessing.sh ver 1.3.1 (This script/pipeline is available at /mnt/lustre/mel/shared/Scripts or on GitHub, in either the KovachLab (https://github.com/KovachLab) or LEFenderson (https://github.com/LEFenderson) GitHub accounts under the Bioinfo-Scripts repository).

2. Relationship between files, if important: 
*.truncated.bz2 files are quality & adapter trimmed fastq files and were generated directly from the *.fastq.gz files.
3. Additional related data collected that was not included in the current data package: 
Environmental and various phenotypic metadata (e.g., bill morphological measurements, song recordings, photos, thermoregulatory imaging data, blood hematocrit measurements etc.), as well as possibly other biological samples (e.g., fecal or feather samples) were also (variably) collected for most of these individuals at the time of sampling. These data and a record of the existence of supplementary data or samples should be stored in the SHARP database, and/or the 'GECO SAMPLES 2019.xlsx' & 'BandFeathHemat_1.csv' files, as well as in my electronic lab notebook (See SpaEx0003 & SpaEx0004). The location of the other biological materials, as well as remaining blood samples not used in the extractions are likely stored *somewhere* in the Kovach lab at the University of New Hampshire (at the time of this writing, any remaining blood cards were stored in 3-hole binders above the middle bench; remaining blood samples in Queens Lysis buffer were stored in boxes on the shelf above the opposite middle bench. I do not know where fecal/urine/feather etc. samples are stored but Adrienne or others should have that information). The DNA extracts and libraries should be at the Hubbard Center for Genome Studies laboratory at the University of New Hampshire.
4. Are there multiple versions of the dataset?: NO
	A. If yes, name of file(s) that was updated: 
		i. Why was the file updated? 
		ii. When was the file updated? 

METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION

1. Description of methods used for collection/generation of data: 
#<Include links or references to publications or other documentation containing experimental design or protocols used in data collection>

Field sampling protocols followed SHARP SOPs for the year of collection. IACUC approval, bird banding permits and site permits where applicable should be available from Adrienne Kovach and/or Brian Olsen (University of Maine), or they would know where to get those numbers.

DNA was extracted from blood of individuals with an Omega E.Z.N.A. Blood DNA Mini kit (Norcross, GA, USA; for samples on blood cards) or a Zymo Quick DNA Miniprep Plus kit (Irvine, California, USA; for samples collected in Queens Lysis buffer) per manufacturers instructions with minor modifications and extracts were quantified with a Qubit 3.0 fluorometer (using broad sensitivity reagents). Genomic DNA was prepared into Illumina TruSeq libraries using a dilute (1/5th ratios) Kapa HyperPlus kit (Roche Sequencing Solutions, Pleasanton, California, USA). Library prep samples were pooled and lightly sequenced on an Illumina iSeq at HCGS to check the pool balance and re-pooled if necessary. The library pool was sequenced on an Illumina Novaseq6000 (SP500) at Dana Farber Institute using paired end 250-bp reads. Some sampling metadata and details pertaining to sample extraction and quantification can be found in the files 'SpaEx0003' & 'SpaEx0004' DNA Extraction sections of my ELN. See also the relevant library prep (SparrowIlluminaSpaLP0003 & SparrowIlluminaSpaLP0004) & sequencing sections (all subsections pertaining to this dataset - '20200728_INVS-SP_LFe_SparrowWholeGenomeShotgun') of the ELN. Any additional methods if they exist may be found in the Research Logs section of my ELN under the Sparrow Comparative Genomics -  Research Notes section. Stephen Simpson (UNH Hubbard Center for Genomic Studies) performed the library prep and pooling/preparation for sequencing and Kelley Thomas has contacts at Dana Farber and oversaw the sample submission for sequencing. Toni Westbrook performed the initial bioinformatic QC for assessing the iSeq results and ran the bcl2fastq pipeline (if not done by Dana Farber service provider?) and generated the sequencing and demultiplexing stats.

2. Methods for processing the data:

To save disc space on Premise, the originial SpaEx000#_##_S##_L00#_R#_001.fastq.gz files were backed up (see 'Data Backup Information' section below) and deleted from Premise so only the concatenated and renamed files remain on the cluster (bgzip2 compressed after quality trimming, as noted above in the 'File List').
    B. Adapters were identified with Adapter Removal ver. 2.3.1:
    I was initially unsure what adapters were used on the libraries so I used AdapterRemoval to identify them for a couple samples. The below adapters listed (i.e., --adapter1 and --adapter2) were used in the adapter removal script. Output below -

    C. FastQC reports were generated with FastQC v0.11.5 and adapters were trimmed with Adapter Removal ver. 2.3.1:
    DataPreProcessingScript.sh ver 1.3.1 was used to run fastQC on the raw reads and quality trim read termini. Metadata and stdout information from the analyses are available in the file DataPreProcessing-20200728_INVS-SP_LFe_SparrowWholeGenomeShotgun-slurmOutput-2021.01.30-22.24.yaml. DataPreProcessingAddendumScript.sh ver 1.3.1 also ran fastQC on the trimmed reads, multiqc on both sets of fastqc files, the adapter removal settings files, and the bcl2fastq data, and to archive and compress the raw reads. Metadata and stdout information from the analyses are available in the file DataPreProcessing-20200728_INVS-SP_LFe_SparrowWholeGenomeShotgun-slurmOutput-2021.01.30-22.24.yaml.

3. Instrument- or software-specific information needed to interpret the data: 
#<include full name and version of software, and any necessary packages or libraries needed to run scripts>
Pooled libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq6000 at Dana Farber Cancer Institute with SP-500 flow cell chemistry (full flow cell was used, i.e. 2 lanes) using 250-bp paired end sequencing.

4. Standards and calibration information, if appropriate: 
N/A

5. Environmental/experimental conditions: 
N/A

6. Describe any quality-assurance procedures performed on the data: 
    A.) Reports - contains the bcl2fastq reports
    B.) Stats directory - files included/generated by Toni Westbrook (Hubbard Center for Genome Studies, University of New Hampshire) or as part of the Dana Farber sequencing service:
        i.) AdapterTrimming.txt, which does not appear very informative, I assume because no adapter trimming was performed on the raw data. Otherwise, I believe it would list for each sample, the total number of bases trimmed for Read1 and Read 2/lane and the percent of bases trimmed, followed by a detailed histogram of the number of bases trimmed per read position for each sample.
        ii.) DemuxSummaryF1L1.txt & DemuxSummaryF1L2.txt files, which lists, for each lane (lane 1 & 2 respectively, I assume the F# is if there is more than 1 flowcell to report on?) and tile number, the fraction of reads that were demuxed and assigned to each individual. Perhaps most usefully, there is a list at the end of the most common barcode combinations for the unknown reads.
        iii.) FastqSummaryF1L1.txt & FastqSummaryF1L2.txt files, which appear to be a summary for each tile the total number of raw reads compared with the number of reads that passed the filter? (PF). Of note, a high proportion (~72% & ~60% respectively) of the unknown reads did not pass the filter, which probably contributes to why they are unknown. Still, a large number of reads DID pass the filter so there could be some good additional data there if it is possible to tease apart who all it belongs to. Only 1 mismatch in the indices was permitted during demultiplexing, so might be worth checking for 2 mismatches if the hamming distance of my indices permits.
        iv.) ConversionStats.xml, DemultiplexingStats.xml & Stats.json files. These are all really detailed if you want to get into the nitty gritty - 
            a.) ConversionStats provides a detailed list for every sample, lane, tile the raw cluster count (# of reads) and the number of clusters (reads) that passed the filter, and within those 2 categories, for each read number, the total yield, (which is the total number of bases read across all clusters), the yield with a quality greater than 30 (presumably the number of bases >Q30), and the quality score sum which I am guessing is the total base quality scores across all reads for that tile. 
            b.) DemultiplexingStats.xml lists for each demultiplexed sample, on a per lane basis, the number of reads with perfectly matching indices and the number of reads with 1 mismatch in the indices that were included in the demultiplexed R1 and R2 files. 
            c.) Stats.json - This file basically compiles the key data from the other 2 files (ConversionStats.xml, DemultiplexingStats.xml) as well as AdapterTrimming.txt into a different format. This is also the target file used by multiqc to summarize the bcl2fastq data.
    C.) FastQC reports for the sequencing data were generated and manually assesed for the raw reads as well as post-adapter/quality trimming (contained in the directories called fastqcRawData and fastqcTrimmedData, respectively). Multiqc reporats were also generated for both sets of fastqc reports, as well as the bcl2fastq data, and the adapter removal settings. My summary and interpretation of the output QC reports is included in my electronic lab notebook.
    D.) For this initial sequencing run, I also conducted extensive assessment of my adapter removal and quality trimming parameters and output to ensure that the pipeline was performing as expected and generating high quality analysis-ready reads. See my electronic lab notebook section entitled 'Sparrow Comparative Genomics > Methods > Data Preprocessing' for detailed justification of pipeline and methods as well as fastqc expectations and parameters for the raw and quality trimmed reads and Adapter Removal parameter evaluation.

7. People involved with sample collection, processing, analysis and/or submission: 
Sample Collection: I believe bleeding of birds was performed by Meghan Conway, Kenzie Roeder, Alice Hotopp, Jon Clark, Adrienne Kovach and Andrew Wiegardt and possibly other technicians (I havent figured out the initials in the SHARP database yet!)
Sample Extraction: Lindsey Fenderson
Library Prep: Library prep and pooling and iSeq sequencing was performed by Stephen Simpson (Hubbard Center for Genome Studies, University of New Hampshire)
Sequencing: Kelley Thomas was responsible for getting these samples sequenced and these samples were submitted for sequencing at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.
Data processing and analysis and submission to NCBI: Lindsey Fenderson (These sequencing data have not been uploaded to NCBI and are not publicly available as of the current date of this document)
