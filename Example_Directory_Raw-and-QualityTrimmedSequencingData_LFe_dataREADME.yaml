DATA & FILE OVERVIEW

1. File List (Edit as needed, especially if alternate pipelines used): 
#<list all files (or folders, as appropriate for dataset organization) contained in the dataset, with a brief description>
    I.) *.truncated.bz2 files - quality trimmed sequencing reads in fastq format.
    II.) Directory RawReads-and-SequencingPreProcessingData, contains the following -
        A.) YYYYMMDD_SEQUENCER_PI_DataDescription_RawSequencingReads.tar.bz2 - Directory which was tar archived & bgzip2 compressed, containing the following:
            i.) R1 & R2 *.fastq.gz files - the raw sequencing reads in fastq format.
            ii.) Stats directory - Stats and metadata pertaining to the sequencing run and sample demultiplexing.
            iii.) Reports directory - .html files that present and summarize the data from the Stats directory files in informative and readable tables.
            iv.) AdapterRemovalSettings directory - Folder containing (for each sample) all of the metadata and stats generated by AdapterRemoval during quality trimming. Includes 1.) the raw *.settings output generated by the AdapterRemoval2 program, which lists the metadata (AdapterRemoval version number, the adapter sequences that were searched for and trimmed) and parameters used in the analysis, summary trimming statistics (e.g., number of discarded reads and singletons, number of retained reads, average read length etc.) and a tabular length distribution histogram of the number of retained reads of a given length in the new pair1.truncated.bz2 & pair2.truncated.bz2 files, as well as the number of singletons, the number of collapsed reads, and the number of truncated collapsed reads combined into the read 1 file, the number of reads discarded and the total number of reads at that read length; 2.) copies of that *.settings output nicely formatted into a .pdf, 3.) and charts made in R summarizing the tabular output length histogram of the distributions of reads in each AdapterRemoval2 category (all, mate 1, mate 2, singleton, collapsed, collapsed & truncated, and discarded).
        B.) YYYYMMDD_SEQUENCER_PI_DataDescription_QCReports.tar.bz2 - Directory which was tar archived & bgzip2 compressed, containing the following:
            i.) fastqcRawData directory (In the FastQCReports directory) - fastQC reports generated from the raw sequencing reads (default .html & .zip output), as well as the reports compiled all into a .pdf.
            ii.) fastqcTrimmedData directory (In the FastQCReports directory) - fastQC reports generated from the trimmed sequencing reads (default .html & .zip output), as well as the reports compiled all into a .pdf.
            iii.) MultiQCReports directory - an .html file (and associated data) generated by multiqc which allows you to easily view qc reports across samples in one chart or table to readily identify any outliers or samples with weird behavior relative to the others. The resulting files should contain summaries for the bcl2fastq data (if available), the raw read fastqc files, the adapter removal settings files, and the quality trimmed fastqc files.
        C.) YYYYMMDD_SEQUENCER_PI_DataDescription_ELNLaTeXCode - Directory containing the following:
            i.) Code generated automatically as part of my data preprocessing script for inserting the FastQC pdf reports of the raw reads into my ELN
            ii.) Code generated automatically as part of my data preprocessing script for inserting the AdapterRemoval settings & chart pdf reports into my ELN
            iii.) Code generated automatically as part of my data preprocessing script for inserting the FastQC pdf reports of the quality trimmed reads into my ELN
            iv.) Code generated automatically as part of my data preprocessing script for inserting the pdf of the calculated md5sums for all of the files in this data directory into my ELN
        D.) Premise-YYYYMMDD_SEQUENCER_PI_DataDescription-md5sum-2021.02.23-10.57 (both .txt & .pdf formats) - A file that lists of all the md5 checksums for every file in the directory as of the time stamp in the file name (in this case, for all of the renamed, concatenated raw reads for each sample, as well as all of the files in the Reports and Stats directories).
        E.) DataPreProcessing-YYYYMMDD_SEQUENCER_PI_DataDescription-slurmOutput-2021.01.30-22.24.pdf - A copy of the file containing all of the slurm output and analysis metadata from the DataPreProcessingV1.3.1.sh analysis which performed all of the data preprocessing to transform the active files in this directory from the raw reads to the mapping-ready reads, i.e., it ran fastQC on the raw reads, performed adapter & quality trimming with adapter removal2, and reran fastQC on the quality trimmed reads. The file was generated and analysis job was submitted using LEF-DataPreProcessing.sh, which ran program DataPreProcessing.sh ver 1.3.1 (This script/pipeline is available at /mnt/lustre/mel/shared/Scripts or on GitHub, in either the KovachLab (https://github.com/KovachLab) or LEFenderson (https://github.com/LEFenderson) GitHub accounts under the Bioinfo-Scripts repository).

2. Relationship between files, if important: 
*.truncated.bz2 files are quality & adapter trimmed fastq files and were generated directly from the *.fastq.gz files.
3. Additional related data collected that was not included in the current data package: 

4. Are there multiple versions of the dataset?: NO
	A. If yes, name of file(s) that was updated: 
		i. Why was the file updated? 
		ii. When was the file updated? 

METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION

1. Description of methods used for collection/generation of data: 
#<Include links or references to publications or other documentation containing experimental design or protocols used in data collection>



2. Methods for processing the data: 
#<describe how the submitted data were generated from the raw or collected data>
    A.  Reads for each lane were concatenated and samples were renamed following our lab naming conventions:

To save disc space on Premise, the originial #_##_S##_L00#_R#_001.fastq.gz files were backed up (see 'Data Backup Information' section below) and deleted from Premise so only the concatenated and renamed files remain on the cluster (bgzip2 compressed after quality trimming, as noted above in the 'File List').
    B. Adapters were identified with Adapter Removal ver. 2.3.1:
  
    C. FastQC reports were generated with FastQC v0.11.5 and adapters were trimmed with Adapter Removal ver. 2.3.1:
    DataPreProcessingScript.sh ver 1.3.1 was used to run fastQC on the raw reads and quality trim read termini. Metadata and stdout information from the analyses are available in the file DataPreProcessing-YYYYMMDD_SEQUENCER_PI_DataDescription-slurmOutput-YYYY.MM.DD-HH.MM.yaml. DataPreProcessingAddendumScript.sh ver 1.3.1 also ran fastQC on the trimmed reads, multiqc on both sets of fastqc files, the adapter removal settings files, and the bcl2fastq data, and to archive and compress the raw reads. Metadata and stdout information from the analyses are available in the file DataPreProcessing-YYYYMMDD_SEQUENCER_PI_DataDescription-slurmOutput-YYYY.MM.DD-HH.MM.yaml.

3. Instrument- or software-specific information needed to interpret the data: 
#<include full name and version of software, and any necessary packages or libraries needed to run scripts>

4. Standards and calibration information, if appropriate: 
N/A

5. Environmental/experimental conditions: 
N/A

6. Describe any quality-assurance procedures performed on the data: 
    A.) FastQC reports for the sequencing data were generated and manually assesed for the raw reads as well as post-adapter/quality trimming (contained in the directories called fastqcRawData and fastqcTrimmedData, respectively). Multiqc reporats were also generated for both sets of fastqc reports, as well as the bcl2fastq data, and the adapter removal settings.
